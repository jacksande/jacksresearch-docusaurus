# JacksResearch.com website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

Make any edits you want to the Markdown files. Then view changes you've made:

```bash
npx docusaurus start
```

Build the website:

```bash
npx docusaurus build
```

Copy the content of the `build` folder to the [jacksande.github.io](https://github.com/jacksande/jacksande.github.io) repository. But don't delete the CNAME file which needs to include the following line:

```text
jacksresearch.com
```
